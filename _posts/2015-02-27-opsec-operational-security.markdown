We live in digital age, but our security still think in old way. Today I read about Operational Security, OPSEC. Some people will say it paranoia but look at that, maybe you will need that.

But a four-figure price is hardly elite enough for the Grugq. ”If they want their bugs fixed, they can buy them at market rates like everyone else,” he says. “From each according to their ability, to each according to their needs? That’s communism. If they want the output, they can pay for it like anyone else. They have my email.”

There are a lot of compound issues which combine to make this sort of “good OPSEC” lifestyle very unhealthy for the human mind:



	
  1. Isolation

	
  2. Compartmentation of the ego

	
  3. Paranoia related stress


Grugq describe some old school behavior still (and more) relevant in digital age.
